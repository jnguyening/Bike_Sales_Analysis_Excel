# Excel Bike Sales Analysis

This foundational retail project demonstrates the power of Microsoft Excel in transforming raw consumer data into a functional business tool. The workflow includes rigorous data cleaning, the creation of custom age-bracket segments via nested IF statements, and the development of a dynamic dashboard using Slicers and Pivot Charts. By analyzing the correlation between commute distance, income, and purchasing intent, the project provides a clear visual narrative of customer purchase behavior.
